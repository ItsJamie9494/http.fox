The HTTP {{ utils::pre(text="302 Found") }} redirect status response code indicates that the resource requested has been
temporarily moved to the URL given by the {{ utils::pre(text="Location") }} header. A browser redirects to this page but
search engines don't update their links to the resource (in 'SEO-speak', it is said that the 'link-juice' is not sent to
the new URL).
<br /><br />
Even if the specification requires the method (and the body) not to be altered when the redirection is performed, not
all user-agents conform here - you can still find this type of bugged software out there. It is therefore recommended to
set the {{ utils::pre(text="302") }} code only as a response for {{ utils::pre(text="GET") }} or {{
utils::pre(text="HEAD" ) }} methods and to use {{ utils::pre(text="307 Temporary Redirect") }} instead, as the method
change is explicitly prohibited in that case.
<br /><br />
In the cases where you want the method used to be changed to {{ utils::pre(text="GET") }}, use {{ utils::pre(text="303
See Other") }} instead. This is useful when you
want to give a response to a {{ utils::pre(text="PUT") }} method that is not the uploaded resource but a confirmation
message such as: 'you
successfully uploaded XYZ'.

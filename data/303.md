The HTTP `303 See Other` redirect status response code indicates that the redirects don't link to
the requested resource itself, but to another page (such as a confirmation page, a representation of a real-world object
or an upload-progress page). This response code is often sent back as a result of `PUT` or `POST`. The
method used to display this redirected page is always `GET`.

The HTTP `200 OK` success status response code indicates that the request has succeeded. A 200
response is cacheable by default.
<br /><br />
The meaning of a success depends on the HTTP request method:

<ul class="ml-4 mb-4 list-disc">
    <li><pre><code>GET</code></pre>: The resource has been fetched and is transmitted in the message body.</li>
    <li><pre><code>HEAD</code></pre>: The representation headers are included in the response without any message body
    </li>
    <li><pre><code>POST</code></pre>: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message
        body</li>
    <li><pre><code>TRACE</code></pre>: The message body contains the request message as received by the server.</li>
</ul>

The successful result of a `PUT` or a `DELETE` is often not a `200 OK` but a `204 No Content` (or a `201 Created`
when the resource is uploaded for the first time).

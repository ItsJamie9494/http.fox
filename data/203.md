The HTTP `203 Non-Authoritative` Information response status indicates that the request was
successful but the enclosed
payload has been modified by a transforming proxy from that of the origin server's `200 OK`
response.
<br /><br />
The `203` response is similar to the value `214`, meaning `Transformation`
Applied, of the Warning header code, which has the
additional advantage of being applicable to responses with any status code.

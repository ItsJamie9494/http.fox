The HTTP `409 Conflict` response status code indicates a request conflict with the current state
of the target resource.
<br /><br />
Conflicts are most likely to occur in response to a `PUT` request. For example, you may get a `409` response when uploading
a file that is older than the existing one on the server, resulting in a version control conflict.

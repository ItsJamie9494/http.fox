The HTTP `509 Bandwidth Limit Exceeded` response code is an unofficial HTTP status code that is
specific to Apache Web Server and cPanel that indicates that the web hosting client has exceeded the bandwidth allotment
on the server-side.

When the `509` status code is received, it means first that the web hosting client is using a
connection or hosting method where the bandwidth is limited.

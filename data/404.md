The HTTP `404 Not Found` response status code indicates that the server cannot find the requested
resource. Links that lead to a 404 page are often called broken or dead links and can be subject to link rot.
<br /><br />
A 404 status code only indicates that the resource is missing: not whether the absence is temporary or permanent. If a
resource is permanently removed, use the `410 Gone` status instead.

The HTTP `103 Early Hints` information response may be sent by a server while it is still
preparing a response, with hints
about the resources that the server is expecting the final response will link.
This allows a browser to start preloading resources even before the server has prepared and sent that final response.
<br /><br />
The early hint response is primarily intended for use with the `Link` header, which indicates the
resources to be loaded.
It may also contain a `Content-Security-Policy` header that is enforced while processing the
early hint.
<br /><br />
A server might send multiple `103` responses, for example, following a redirect. Browsers only
process the first early
hint response, and this response must be discarded if the request results in a cross-origin redirect. Preloaded
resources from the early hint are effectively pre-pended to the Document's head element, and then followed by the
resources loaded in the final response.

The HTTP `201 Created` success status response code indicates that the request has succeeded and
has led to the creation of a resource. The new resource, or a description and link to the new resource, is effectively
created before the response is sent back
and the newly created items are returned in the body of the message, located at either the URL of the request, or at the
URL in the value of the `Location` header.
<br /><br />
The common use case of this status code is as the result of a `POST` request.

The HTTP `206 Partial Content` success status response code indicates that the request has
succeeded and the body contains the requested ranges of data, as described in the `Range` header
of the request.
<br /><br />
If there is only one range, the `Content-Type` of the whole response is set to the type of the
document, and a
`Content-Range` is provided.
<br /><br />
If several ranges are sent back, the `Content-Type` is set to multipart/byteranges and each
fragment covers one range,
with `Content-Range` and `Content-Type` describing it.

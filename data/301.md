    <p><span class="font-bold">Note:</span> Although the specification requires the method and the body to remain unchanged when the
redirection is performed, not all user-agents meet this requirement. Use the 301 code only as a response for GET or HEAD
methods and use the 308 Permanent Redirect for POST methods instead, as the method change is explicitly prohibited with
this status.</p>

The HTTP `301 Moved Permanently` redirect status response code indicates that the requested
resource has been definitively moved to the URL given by the `Location` headers. A browser
redirects to the new URL and
search engines update their links to the resource.
